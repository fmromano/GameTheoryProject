%Simple Match function
%All jobs will be matched together as if this is a normal matching game.
%Any leftover jobs will be placed in a waiting list with the shortest
%waiting time.

%Initialize computer preferences and job preferences.


%Do an initial match.  Since the cores are indirectly accounted for in the
%computer's preferences, this will need to be an iterative process.


%Start a while loop that will end when either all of the jobs are assOuigned
%or all of the cores are taken.

%Output the matches, leftovers, and efficiency (will be used to see how
%well this method works).
