Proposed Algorithm Comparison Code README

Written by:  Ferdinando Romano and Kristen Hines
December 2014

To run this code, open comparisonScript.m.  In there, you
can change the parameters mentioned in the paper.

The algorithm files are:
simpleMatching.m
deferredAcceptance.m
deferredAcceptance2.m
proposedAlgorithm.m

The files that performed the calculations are:
speedCalc.m
resourceCalc.m

Supporting files are:
collegeAdmissionsGame.m
compPreferences.m
jobPreferences.m
count_unique.m
comparisonFunction.m
updateCoreAvailabilityMatrix.m (for proposed algorithm only)
updateCoreAvailabilityMatrix.m (for deferred acceptance 2 algorithm only)

The example files folder holds the test examples used at different stages
of this project.

The saved data folder holds the interesting data acquired during multiple tests
or data needed for debugging purposes.
