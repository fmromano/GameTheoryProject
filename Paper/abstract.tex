Abstract

The assignment of jobs to separate compute clusters 
can be approached using matching theory. 
The problem is modeled as a modified college admissions
game where each institution has multiple quotas,
each of which is of a specified type.
An algorithm based on multiple iterations of the 
colleged admissions deferred acceptance algorithm is 
proposed.
The algorithm is shown to terminate, result in 
a stable mathcing, and, under certain common conditions,
approximate an optimal solution.
The proposed algorithm is simulated 
and shown to result in either significant improvement 
or only minor regression compared to other approaches.
